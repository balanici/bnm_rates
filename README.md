Install as a simple drupal 7 module.
it will create table for currencies and for rates
You'll find a block named bnm currency rates
On first attempt to display currencies, this will pull xml data
bnm.org offers xml data in 3 langs: en, ru, md. md means moldovan, it is same as romanian,
so in multilanguage site feel free to use either md or ro (drupal's moldavian lang offers 'mo' instead of 'md'
module takes care of it.
